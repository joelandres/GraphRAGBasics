Initially, Scrooge is known for his negative views on Christmas, which starkly contrast with the festive spirit typically associated with the holiday. His disdain for Christmas is a central theme in the story, highlighting his initial reluctance to partake in the celebrations and gatherings that define the season.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's journey is marked by a series of supernatural events and transformative visions that occur during the Christmas holiday. He is visited by spirits, which serve as catalysts for his change. These supernatural encounters are deeply tied to the Christmas season, emphasizing the holiday's significance in Scrooge's transformation. Through these visions, Scrooge reflects on his past experiences during Christmas, allowing him to confront his previous attitudes and behaviors.\n\nAs the story progresses, Scrooge's attitude towards Christmas shifts dramatically. The spirits' visits and the transformative visions lead him to a more reflective state, where he begins to understand the importance of the holiday and the values it represents. This change is evident as Scrooge becomes involved in Christmas celebrations and gatherings, embracing the festive spirit he once rejected.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge's transformation is complete, and he becomes known for keeping Christmas well after his change. His newfound appreciation for the holiday and its traditions marks a significant departure from his former disdainful attitude. Christmas, initially the event Scrooge was disdainful of, becomes central to his story, symbolizing his personal growth and redemption.\n\nIn summary, Ebenezer Scrooge's journey during the Christmas season is one of profound change. From a man who initially scorned the holiday, he evolves into someone who cherishes and celebrates it, embodying the true spirit of Christmas.
