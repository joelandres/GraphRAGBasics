If these shadows\nremain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.'\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.'\n\n'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,'\nreturned the Ghost, 'will find him here. What then? If he be like to\ndie, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'\n\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and\nwas overcome with penitence and grief.\n\n'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear\nthat wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and\nwhere it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It\nmay be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit\nto live than millions like this poor man's child. O God! to hear the\ninsect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry\nbrothers in the dust!'\n\nScrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and, trembling, cast his eyes\nupon the ground. But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name.\n\n'Mr. Scrooge!' said Bob. 'I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the\nFeast!'\n\n'The Founder of the Feast, indeed!' cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. 'I\nwish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and\nI hope he'd have a good appetite for it.'\n\n'My dear,' said Bob, 'the children! Christmas Day.'\n\n'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks\nthe health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\nScrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do,\npoor fellow!'\n\n'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer. 'Christmas Day.'\n\n'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs. Cratchit,\n'not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year!\nHe'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt!'\n\nThe children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their\nproceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of\nall, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the\nfamily. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which\nwas not dispelled for full five minutes.\n\nAfter it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from\nthe mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit\ntold them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which\nwould bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly. The two\nyoung Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man\nof business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that\nbewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's,\nthen told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she\nworked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for\na good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how\nshe had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord\n'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar\nso high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All\nthis time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by\nthey had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny\nTim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\n\nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family;\nthey were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof;\ntheir clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely\ndid, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful,\npleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they\nfaded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's\ntorch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny\nTim, until the last.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as\nScrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the\nroaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was\nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a\ncosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire,\nand deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\nThere, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to\nmeet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the\nfirst to greet them.
